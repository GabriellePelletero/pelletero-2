What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
My keytakeaways from this exercise is that designing a page can be tough and time consuming. I realized that I had forgotten some aspects of HTML and CSS, but by revisiting related topics, I managed to build a simple design. Designing can be hard because it's not taught uniformly.
